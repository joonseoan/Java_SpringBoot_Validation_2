- validation
  . Annotate the fields that need validation.
    @Min(18)
    private Integer age;
  . Pass in a bad input.
  . The handler method validates the fields.
  . A `BindingResult` carries the result of the validation.
  . A negative `BindingResult` forces the user to stay in the form.
  . Thymeleaf catches the errors and displays them.

- dependency setup
  . Google: "spring boot validation dependency"
  . https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-validation
